# Medicrypt

Medicrypt is a simple Python program that will take an image and encrypted it to allow it to be sent to a recipient. The recipient will then decrypt the image using the provided decryption key. The program is GUI-based and must be downloaded to the devices that need to encrypt/decrypt images. 

In this scenario, we wanted to create a solution that reflects the need for privacy in the medical field. In theory, our program should encrypted sensitive medical files that need to be transfered through or outside the hospital network.
